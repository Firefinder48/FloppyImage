# FloppyImage

Ensure Python is installed on your system to run this script.
  
Instructions:
  Save this script to a file, for example, create_floppy.py.
  Run the script from a command line or terminal, passing the desired path for the floppy disk image as an argument. 
  
For example:
    python create_floppy.py /path/to/blank_floppy.img
    Replace /path/to/blank_floppy.img with your desired path and filename for the floppy disk image.

Notes:
  On Windows, the script uses fsutil, which is a command available in Windows to create a file of a specified size. However, administrative privileges might be required to use fsutil.
  
  On Linux and macOS, the script uses the dd command to create the floppy disk image. The dd command is available by default in most Unix-like operating systems.
  
  The script formats the floppy disk image on POSIX systems with the FAT12 file system. If you need a specific file system on the image, modify as needed.
